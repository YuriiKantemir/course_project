  Scenario Outline: User does login with valid credentials
    Given I navigate to login page
    When I set "username" field value "<Username>" on login page
    And I set "password" field value "<Password>" on login page
    And I click "Sign in" button
    Then error message is not present on login page
    Examples:
      | Username | Password |

      | admin    | admin    |
